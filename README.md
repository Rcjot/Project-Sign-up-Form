Hi! project sign up form, tbh just skimmed everything to get here, but i still want to practice what i skimmed. I want to implement everything in intermediate CSS Concepts if possible.

- try to use resets?
- try to use different text styles!
- advanced selectors
- if positioning is needed
- try to use calc for measuring sizes


challenging part only is reading the documentations lol..

I couldn't do the confirming password thingy.
